# Valer's First Hackpad
As you can probably tell it's my first hackpad. It was designed with the intention of including everything that can be useful in a compact size. It has 7 keys, a rotary encoder and a 0.91 inch OLED screen. It uses KMK firmware. Please consider that I'm not advanced in this field.
## Features
* 3D Printed Case
* 3D Printed Insert
* 128x32 0.91 OLED screen
* Rotary Encoder
* 7 Keys
## CAD Model
For ease of printing it uses the standard base(tutorial) however redesigned to fit my parts. It was made wider, taller and the hole in the side for the microprocessor was relocated. The cutouts were adjusted accordingly to everything.(The outside is only reflective because that's the only way I could render it)

## Firmware
This HackPad uses KMK firmware.
I haven't assigned specifics to the buttons as I will be doing that after the assembly.
This is the only part which I'm completely unsure if it was done right, if no I would greatly appreciate help.
## BOM
This is a list of all the parts:
* 7x Cherry MX Switch (preferably brown)
* 7x Keycaps
* The same screws and mounts the tutorial uses
* 1x 128x32 0.91inch OLED screen
* 1x Rotary Encoder
* 1x XIAO RP2040
* 1x Case (2 printed parts)
