# Valer's First Hackpad
As you can probably tell it's my first hackpad. It was designed with the intention of including everything that can be useful in a compact size. It has 7 keys, a rotary encoder and a 0.91 inch OLED screen. It uses KMK firmware. Please consider that I'm not advanced in this field.
## Features
* 3D Printed Case
* 3D Printed Insert
* 128x32 0.91 OLED screen
* Rotary Encoder
* 7 Keys
## CAD Model
For ease of printing it uses the standard base(tutorial) however redesigned to fit my parts. It was made wider, taller and the hole in the side for the microprocessor was relocated. The cutouts were adjusted accordingly to everything.
